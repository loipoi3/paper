## Setup

Before running any scripts or starting the project, you must configure the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to include the path to the repository. This ensures that Python can locate the modules and packages within the repository correctly.

Execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/the/repository"
```
